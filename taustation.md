# An Introduction to Tau Station

[Tau Station](https://alpha.taustation.space/) is a text-based online RPG set
in the future in space, in a post-catastrophic environment.

I was a tester in the closed alpha testing phase, and want to document the
things I wished I knew before I started.

Note that Tau Station is under active development. Hence, parts of this
document might become outdated when the game changes.

## The Financial System

There are *credits* and *bonds*.

### Credits

Credits is everyday money that you can
earn pretty easily. With credits, you can pay for things such as hotel
rooms, public shuttles for inter-station travel, University courses, and weapons and armor. 

You can earn credits through

* career tasks
* selling items (for example found in the Ruins)
* daily career payments
* side jobs
* discreet work
* levelling up
* missions (though most missions don't pay well financially)

### Bonds

Bonds are harder to earn, and can be used to pay for things that make
playing easier or faster:

* VIP packs
* accelerating University courses
* boosting training
* bribing for extra rations
* faster release from the Brig (prison) and Sick Bay
* faster shuttle travel

This list is roughly sorted by the utility. VIP packs and accelerated
University courses are a pretty good way to spend bonds, while I'd only
use bonds for the other purposes if there was a pretty good reason.

You can obtain bonds in the following ways:

* you can buy them in the shop
* as a daily reward for your career level
* you can find bond packages in the Ruins
* sometimes, discreet/anonymous work has a small bonds reward
* if you level up to a new tier (if you reach levels 6 and 11),
  you get a bonds reward

## Stats and Focus

Whenever you try something, and the success is not a foregone
conclusion, you use up some of your *Focus*, and one of the five
*stats*: Strength, Agility, Stamina, Intelligence, Social.

### Stats Regeneration

Every five Minutes, your Focus and stats automatically regenerate. The
rate of regeneration if higher if:

* you are currently a VIP
* you are "well fed" from consuming a ration earlier
* you are in your hotel room
* you have been in your hotel room continually for a while
* you have completed one of the "Anatomy" University courses, available
  on the Nouveau Limoges station

Regeneration is slower if you are confined to the Sick Bay or the Brig.

### Stats Improvement

Most stations (all except the jump gates) feature a Gym, where you can
invest focus and current stat values to train the physical stats
(*strength*, *agility*, *stamina*).

You can train *intelligence* in a similar fashion in a hotel room of an
Inn, or at a University (scroll to the very bottom of the page). Most
stations (all except the jump gates and Moissan) have an Inn, and four
stations have a University (Tau, Nouveau Limoges, Moissan, Spirit of
Botswana).

You can also train intelligence while traveling with public shuttles.

The *social* stat can be trained at the Lounge that belongs to an inn.

The efficiency of training of any of these stats depends on the station.
In general, higher-level stations yield better training benefits. For
example on Tau Station (level 1), you get about a 0.004 stats increase
for every 10% of focus that you invest. On Yards of Gadani (level 10),
the stat increase is around 0.019.

Training can lead to injury (and thus unconsciousness or time at the
Sick Bay) if your stats are too low. Each gym has a minimal sum of
combined physical stats that you need to avoid injury, starting with 30
at Tau Station and going up to 39 at Bordeaux and Yards of Gadani.
Similar limits (though not explicitly denoted) apply to training of the
social and the intelligence stat.

Stats can also randomly increase as a bonus of successfully completed
anonymous work.

## What To Do

As in every RPG, there are several different things you can do, with
different resource requirements and payoffs.

### Missions

Missions are fun! You can find a mission by clicking on the "Find a
mission" link in the "Employment" box. A mission opportunity is marked
by the orange action flag, either in an area or next to person.

During missions, you typically invest focus and some stats. After you
have finished the missions on Tau Station, you must travel to other
stations to find missions, and those missions might again prompt you to
other stations, which costs you credits (and there are missions that
require at least three interstellar travels). Also, sometimes bribing
somebody with your own credits is the easiest way to convince an NPC to
collaborate.

Missions give you a small financial reward, and typically the largest
experience reward that is available in the whole game. But most
importantly, missions are interactive short stories that are enjoyable
to read and experience.

### Ruins Scavenging

Most stations have a *Ruins* area, where you can scavenge for discarded
treasures. Each search costs 10% stamina, and if you find something,
also 10% of focus. Each successful find also adds to your experience.

The things you can find in the ruins include (in decreasing likelihood):

* nothing
* common trade goods (sell for less than 1 credit)
* weapons
* armor
* bond packages
* VIP packs
* rare trade goods (sell for 5000 credits or more)

You can carry around what you find, up to a certain mass limit. If you
carry around too much, you will get a warning that your are encumbered,
and lower success rates for tests against the physical stats.

If you don't want to carry around stuff, you can sell it (go to Market
-> Vendors and then to your Inventory), store it (go to Market -> Storage,
buy storage if you haven't yet and then to your Inventory), or drop them
right from the Inventory.

### Pursue a Career

You can and should pursue a career. Performing career tasks is the most
reliable source of credits, and once you have been promoted a few times,
the only reliable in-game source of bonds.

#### Choosing Your Career

When I picked my career, I read through the descriptions, and picked the
one that sounded best. You should be more strategic in your choice.

The first factor you should consider is the primary and secondary stat
associated with the career task. You should favor a career that makes
use of Intelligence, because in the context of University courses, it
makes sense to boost that stat.
All else being equal, you should avoid careers whose tasks make heavy
use of stamina, so that you can use your stamina to rummage in the
Ruins.

The second factor is availability. Career tasks can be tied to locations
(you can only repair ships at a Port, and only analyze security footage
at Security), and not all stations have all areas. Ports are everywhere,
Sick Bay, Cloning Vats, Brig and Security are also nearly ubiquitous.

Finally, some careers are more dangerous than others; if a majority of
tasks sound illegal, you might spend quite some time in the Brig.
(Though illegal tasks tend to pay much better than comparable legal
tasks).

Note that you can abort your career at any time, and even later return
to that career with no repercussions, except of course the time you
missed advancing your career.

#### Advancing Your Career

You advance your career by succeeding at career tasks. You go to
different areas of the station, and click on the "Tasks" tab, and then
attempt some tasks. Each success adds some amount of career experience to
a hidden account, and each failure subtracts some amount.

Each night at GCT 0/0 (which coincides with midnight UTC), the number of days
you spent in a career rank
increases. Once your career experience is high enough (whatever
that means) *and* you have spent enough days in the current career rank, you
are promoted. (If you fail enough tasks, you can also be demoted again).
Also at midnight you receive your regular payments of bonds and credits,
depending on your current career level.

Career tasks use up 20% of the affected stat, and 5% focus. On success,
you get a bonus in credits, which is the primary source of most player's
credit wealth.

As your hidden career experience increases and/or you are promoted,
more difficult career tasks become achievable. In general, you should
try career tasks where your success rate is higher than 50%. If your
success rate is higher than 80% or 90%, you might try more difficult
tasks (which are those further down the list).

Another factor in the success rate of career tasks is the maximum value
of the stat that is tested. Training your strength makes it easier to
lift heavy stuff, right?

### Side Jobs

Side jobs are brief, one-off jobs that pay a fixed reward. They consist
of tests against the same stat until you have passed five of them. They
pay less than career tasks, but give you more experience.

The available side jobs and their pay depend on the station.

### Discreet Work

*Discreet Work* aka *Anonymous Missions* are automatically generated
missions that, on completion, give you a small amount of credits, and
more importantly, a random bonus. This bonus can be

* more credits
* an increase in one stat
* a weapon or armour
* a bond package
* a ration
* a VIP packs

In most cases, the potential rewards depends on the station level. For
example on Taungoo Station (level 5), the stats boost tends to be on the
order of 0.02, while you get something closer to 0.04 on Yards of Gadani
(level 10).

Completing discreet work also approves your reputation with the
affiliation of the government that controls the current station, which
in turn leads to shorter Brig times when you get caught doing something
illegal.

Some of the anonymous missions involve stealing an item from somebody,
and bringing it to somebody else. Between those two actions, the item
is in your own inventory, and you can steal it by aborting the mission.
The only repercussion is that after aborting an anonymous mission, you
won't be offered a new one for a while. For valuable items such as
rations, bond packages or VIP packs, this is usually worth it.

## University Courses

University courses can teach you handy skills. You have to pay some
credits to enroll in one, and can optionally spend bonds to speed them
up. The basic courses are relatively cheap and fast, while more advanced
courses take much longer, and can cost up to several ten thousand
credits.

You can only be enrolled in one course at a time, and you cannot abort a
course that you started.

In the beginning, you can likely only afford basic courses, so you
should enroll in those.

One module that can be generally recommended is the collection of
Anatomy courses available on Nouveau Limoges, since it boosts stats
recovery -- something that is useful no matter what career you pursue.

Having an above-average intelligence (as shown by the stats ranking on
your character page) makes courses faster.

The following modules are available, grouped by station:

* Tau Station (Sol)
    * Business: Bureaucracy
    * Combat: Combat Basics, Intermediate Combat, Defensive Tactics
    * Engineering: Basic Engineering, Electronics
* Nouveau Limoges (Sol)
    * Engineering: Basic Engineering
    * Medicine: First Aid, Anatomy
    * Psychology: International Relations
* Moissan Station (Alpha Centauri)
    * Medicine: First Aid
* Spirit of Botswana (Alpha Centauri)
    * Combat: Combat Basics, Advanced Combat, Special Ops
    * Engineering: Electronics

## VIP Packs

VIP packs provide many benefits, documented
[here](https://taustation.space/blog/shop-grand-opening-next-steps/).
The most important ones are 150%, much faster stats regeneration, and
larger experience gains.

Playing with an active VIP pack is significantly more fun and more
efficient. When you first use one, all your stats go to 100%, so it
makes sense to exhaust your stats through career tasks or so before you
use one.

The following are sources of VIP packs:

* You can buy them in the shop
* You can buy a 3-day VIP pack every 7 days at the Market, for 290 bonds
* You can find VIP packs in the ruins
* Sometimes, the random reward for discreet work can be a VIP pack

## Travel

You can travel from station to station within a solar system through
local shuttles. If you want to travel to a station in another solar
system, you first need to travel to a jump gate, from there to the other
solar system's jump gate, and from there to the station you want.

Travel depends on the distance between stations, which varies depending
on the current orbital positions.

You can't do anything except training intelligence during travels, but
stats and focus slowly regenerate. So before longer journeys, it makes
sense to use up your current stats for career tasks.

While planning your travel, be aware that hotel rooms cost more at
higher-level stations, and that shifting orbit positions can make the
travel back more expensive.

You need a Gaule visa for visiting stations under the Gaule government
(basically any station with French sounding names). As a VIP, you can
buy a Gaule visa at any station's Gov't center. Otherwise, you need to
buy it a Gaule Embassy on Tau Station (Sol) or Spirit of Botswana (Alpha
Centauri).

## Player and Station Levels

All players start from level 1, and gain experience through

* missions
* side jobs
* career tasks
* discreet work

When you reach 100% experience of the current career level, you ascend
to the next level. On leveling up, you receive a small bonus in credits.

Each block of five levels is called a *tier*, and ascending to a higher
tier also gives a bonus of 500 bonds.

Leveling up also gives you access to more missions, which have minimal
player levels as prerequisites.

Stations have levels too. You can enter stations with a higher level
than your own player level, and perform career tasks, train in the gym,
train your intelligence in the hotel room, or social in the lounge,
provided that the relevant stat is high enough. You won't be able to do
missions, anonymous work or side jobs though.

Higher-level stations generally

* have higher yields for stats training
* tend to have higher limits for safe stats training
* let you find more valuable weapons and armor in the Ruins
* have more expensive hotel rooms
* have higher-paying side jobs and discreet work

All of these factors combined mean that, as long as you are not playing
missions, it makes sense to spend your time on higher-level stations.
