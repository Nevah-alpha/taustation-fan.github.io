# Private Ships

You can buy private ships, and use those for travel. Since this requires
several expensive and long University courses and at least 210,000 credits
for the cheapest type of ship, this should be considered an advanced feature.

## Prerequisites 

In order to buy a *Private Shuttle*, you need to complete the following
University courses, in this order:

* Introduction to Spaceship Operations (all Universities, 100 Segments)
* Basic Space Navigation (all Universities, 700 Segments)
* Basic Ship Technology (all Universities 1400 Segments)
* Basic Ship Handling (Spirit of Botswana, 2100 Segments)

If you want to buy a *Razorback* (faster and much more expensive), you will
need these additional courses:

* Advanced Ship Technology (Moissan)
* Advanced Ship Handling (?)

## Ship Types

Once you have the prerequisite University courses and enough credits,
you can go to a shipyard and buy a ship.

The following table shows the available and the planned ship types:

## Operating a Ship

Once you buy a ship, you have to give it a name (length between 3 and 100 characters), and then it becomes available at the Docks.

At the Docks, you can enter the ship, and choose a destination. On a Jump Gate,
the destination can be a connected jump gate or a local station. On other stations,
you can just select local destinations.

Using a ship consumes fuel proportionally to the travel time. You
can refuel at any dock, though the price per fuel depends on the
station, and is roughly proportional to the station level. It varies
between roughly 1,500 credits per gram on Tau Station to about 12,000
credits per gram on Yards of Gadani and Bordeaux.

Refueling is also very slow, but you can spend bonds to speed it up.

Traveling to local stations is cheaper with the private shuttle than
with public shuttles; the interstellar jump is slightly more expensive
if you refuel at Tau Station, and much more expensive if you refuel
anywhere in Alpha Centauri.

## Maintenance

Ships require regular but infrequent repairs, and occasional
refurbishments.

Repairs are somewhat affordable on Shipyards, but fairly expensive
on stations without shipyards.

For instance, repairing a 4% damage at the Docks takes around 70 segments
(more than half a day!), and during
the time of repair, you are confined to docks. You can spend bonds to
reduce the repair time.
