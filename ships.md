# Private Ships

You can buy private ships, and use those for travel. Since this requires
several expensive and long University courses and at least 210,000 credits
for the cheapest type of ship, this should be considered an advanced feature.

## Prerequisites 

In order to buy a *Private Shuttle*, you need to complete the following
University courses, in this order:

* Introduction to Spaceship Operations (all Universities, 100 Segments)
* Basic Space Navigation (all Universities, 700 Segments)
* Basic Ship Technology (all Universities, 1400 Segments)
* Basic Ship Handling (Spirit of Botswana, 2100 Segments)

If you want to buy a *Razorback* (faster and much more expensive), you will
need these additional courses:

* Advanced Ship Technology (Moissan, 2100 Segments)
* Advanced Ship Handling (Nouveau Limoges, 2800 Segments)

## Ship Types

Once you have the prerequisite University courses and enough credits,
you can go to a shipyard and buy a ship. (There is a shipyard on The Maid of
Orléans, but it doesn't sell any ships.)

The following table shows the available and the planned ship types:

## Operating a Ship

Once you buy a ship, you have to give it a name (length between 3 and
100 characters, Unicode allowed), and then it becomes available at the Docks. A newly
bought ship is fully fueled.

At the Docks, you can enter the ship, and choose a destination. On a Jump Gate,
the destination can be a connected jump gate or a local station. On other stations,
you can just select local destinations.

Using a ship consumes fuel proportionally to the travel distance. You
can refuel at any dock, though the price per fuel depends on the
station, and is roughly proportional to the station level. It varies
between roughly 1,500 credits per gram on Tau Station to about 12,000
credits per gram on Yards of Gadani and Bordeaux:

| Station level | price in credits/gram | System         |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------|
|      1        |         1,500         | Sol            |
|      3        |         4,020         | Sol            |
|      4        |         5,220         | Sol            |
|      5        |         6,420         | Sol            |
|      6        |         7,590         | Sol            |
|      7        |         8,760         | Alpha Centauri |
|      8        |         9,870         | Alpha Centauri |
|      9        |        10,980         | Alpha Centauri |
|     10        |        12,090         | Alpha Centauri |
|     11        |        13,100         | Barnard's Star |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------|

Refueling is also slow, but you can spend bonds to speed it up.

Traveling to local stations is cheaper with the private shuttle than
with public shuttles; the interstellar jump is slightly more expensive
if you refuel at Tau Station, and much more expensive if you refuel
anywhere except in Sol.

There are University courses available to reduce fuel consumption and to
reduce the damage that ships take during normal operation.
The *Basic Fuel Efficiency* course reduces fuel usage by 5%,
and the *Advanced* and *Mastery* course each add another 5% fuel savings.

## Maintenance

Ships require regular repairs, and occasional refurbishments.

Once a health bar of a ship reaches 75% or below, or when the
navigation computers are "not operational", the ship requires repair
before you can fly it again.

If you are lucky, and the current station has a shipyard, the repairs
can be done for you by payed workers, which means you can do not have to
be present during the repairs -- but it costs about twice as much as
repairing it yourself.

On stations without a shipyard, you have to repair your ship at the
docks, which is cheaper, but confines you to the docks during the repair.

In either case, you can spend 10 bonds to halve the repair time.

A repair only brings the health up to 75%. Refurbishment at a shipyard
costs an additional 2000 credits, and completely restores the health
of the ship.
