# This is a test with inline HTML (especially tables)

Will it be rendered when viewing the markdown page itself, and, more
importantly, on the github pages?

## Some plain old divs and ps

The following contains some regular old div and p tags.

    <div>This is inside a div.</div>

    <p>This is inside a p.</p>

<div>This is inside a div.</div>

<p>This is inside a p.</p>

## A simple table

### Ancient HTML

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td>table row 1, cell 1</td>
            <td>table row 1, cell 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>table row 2, cell 1</td>
            <td>table row 2, cell 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>table row 1, cell 1</td>
        <td>table row 1, cell 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>table row 2, cell 1</td>
        <td>table row 2, cell 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

This concludes our tests for now.
