# Syndicates

Syndicates are group of players with a common agenda teaming up.
They are roughly equivalent to guilds or teams of other games.

## Formation Process

To form a syndicate, the designated leader must fulfill these requirements:

* Level 16 or higher
* Reputation *respected* to higher with the Consortium or Gaule
* must have finished the course *Syndicate Basics* (which has *Introduction to Leadership* as a prerequisite)
* must have at least 100,000 credits at their disposal.

Having fulfilled these requirements, a player can go to a government center of
the respective government, spend the 100,000 credits, and use this to
found the syndicate. It needs a name, a three-letter shorthand (limited to a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and a description (up to 300 characters).

A syndicate can specify a minimal player level and a required genotype for members.

Within the next 5 days, a syndicate needs three more co-signers at the same
local government center. The three co-signers need only fulfill the genotype
and level requirements of the syndicate (if any), there are no reputation or
monetary requirements for the co-signers or other syndicate members.

## Membership Management

Once a syndicate has its three co-signers, it is fully formed. The co-signers
automatically become applicants at the syndicate.

The owner can then approve or reject applicants, and configure whether the
syndicate is recruiting or not. If it is recruiting, players can apply
independently of location.

A syndicate starts with slots for 10 members. This limit can be extended
by spending bonds: 

|Extension to|Cost in bonds| cumulative costs |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| 15         | 990         | 990              |
| 20         | 1290        | 2280             |
| 25         | 1790        | 4070             |
| 30         | 3090        | 7160             |


A syndicate also earns one slot for each tier-up (so every 5 levels).
Membership capacity is limited to 40.

The syndicate founder can approve applicants, kick members, and even
ban them from re-applying. They can also give other members the same
privilege by applying the *Membership Management* role.

## Banking

Syndicates have a separate bank accounts. Members can donate bonds and
credits to the syndicate.

There is also a 5% tax by default on any credits that members get or 
deposit into the bank, and this 5% is diverted to the syndicate bank account.

This tax rate can be changed to any integer number between 0 and 100% 
inclusive by the syndicate members with "Money management" right.

## Communication

Syndicate members are clearly marked on their profile page as being a
member of a syndicate, and the chat shows the three-letter shorthand.

Syndicates get a private private chat room.

Syndicate members can also send broadcast in-mails to all members of the
syndicate.

## Experience

Syndicates gain experience points through member activity,
and level up when the experience counter reaches 100%.

So far, it is unclear what syndicate experience or levels is good for,
except that syndicate levels are also grouped in tiers, and the
syndicate gets another slot when ascending to another tier.

## Benefits

At this time, there are no direct benefits to syndicate members; those
are planned for the near future.
